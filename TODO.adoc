== Minimal malware analyst use case

* vagrant: punch hole through NAT for IDA in firewall
* vagrant no net, NAT
* doc: vagrant update box + send on network (archiving)
* doc: vagrant team workflow
** vagrant box repackaging covered here: http://huestones.co.uk/node/305
* git malware analysis template integrated with malboxes
* Integrate virtualbox and wireshark tips: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Network_tips

* Watch this: http://static.sstic.org/videos2016/SSTIC_2016-06-02_P07.mp4

== missing things

* chocolatey package for ollydbg 2

== bugs

* Win10 disable malware protection, cloud and automatic submission
* Win10 desktop virtualbox share doesn't work

=== inetsim json config

		"vboxmanage_post": [
			["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--nic1", "intnet"],
			["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--intnet1", "malwarelab"]
		],

== Install process

* Make easily customizable in `Autounattend.xml`
** license key
** computer name
** username
** NetworkLocation: Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup | OOBE | NetworkLocation (Win7 at least)

* Concept of pre-built profiles: Work (crimeware/APTs?) vs Home (crimeware)

== Improvements to Autounattend.xml

* Perform automatic updates on initial setup
* Automatic updates configuration (disabled/enabled)

== Cleanup

* Consolidate duplicated info (arch specifics) in installconfig/windows10/

== Vagrant things to try or document

* config.vm.box_url

=== Other things

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network "public_network"

=== In the box Vagranfile

To communicate with the user:

    config.vm.post_up_message

== Support Linux targets

TODO

== Support QEMU targets (other archs)

To do malware analysis on embedded systems.

* QEMU on Windows, https://qemu.weilnetz.de/

== Support different back-ends

* Libvirt/KVM: https://github.com/jakobadam/packer-qemu-templates/tree/master/windows

== Support WinXP

Talk to sholmes, he did it.

== Optimizations

* https://github.com/W4RH4WK/Debloat-Windows-10

=== Use VirtualBox's linked_clones Vagrant config
