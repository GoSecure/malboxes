Vagrant box builder and config generator for malware analysis

https://github.com/gosecure/malboxes


== Requirements

* Python 3.3+
* appdirs
* jinja2
* packer: https://www.packer.io/intro/getting-started/setup.html
* vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html


== Installation

=== Linux/Unix

* Install git, vagrant and packer using your distribution's packaging tool
  (packer is sometimes called packer-io)
* `pip install` malboxes:
+
    sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes


=== Windows

==== Manually

* Install https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox],
  https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant] and
  https://git-scm.com/downloads[git]
* https://www.packer.io/downloads.html[Install Packer], drop the packer binary
  in a folder in your user's PATH like `C:\Windows\System32\`
* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Install Python 3] (make sure to add
  Python to your environment variables)
* Open a console (Windows-Key + cmd)
+
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes

==== Using Chocolatey

[NOTE]
Two issues are preventing chocolatey install to work right now:
https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages/pull/261[Python3
Scripts directory is not in the PATH] and
https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/issues/836[problems with zip files on
32-bit Windows].

Assuming you have https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey] installed:

* Install dependencies:
+
    choco install python vagrant packer git virtualbox
+
* Refresh the console
+
    refreshenv
+
* Install malboxes:
+
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes


== Usage

=== Box creation

This creates your base box that is imported in Vagrant. Afterwards you can
re-use the same box several times per sample analysis.

Run:

    malboxes build <profile>

You can also list all supported profiles with:

    malboxes list

This will build a Vagrant box ready for malware investigation you can now
include it in a Vagrantfile afterwards.

For example:

    malboxes build win10_64_analyst

If you want to customize your configuration, look at the following location
for a `config.js` file:

* Linux/Unix: `~/.config/malboxes/`
* Mac OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/malboxes/`
* Win 7+: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\malboxes\malboxes\`


=== Per analysis instances

    malboxes spin win10_64_analyst <name>

This will create a `Vagrantfile` prepared to use for malware analysis. Move it
into a directory of your choice and issue:

    vagrant up

By default the local directory will be shared in the VM on the Desktop. This
can be changed by commenting the relevant part of the `Vagrantfile`.

For example:

    malboxes spin win7_32_analyst 20160519.cryptolocker.xyz

// FIXME

=== Customization

You can modify (add, modify or delete) registry keys, directories and files like this:

Registry keys:

    malboxes registry <profile> <modtype> <key name> <value> <valuetype>

Example:

    malboxes registry win10_64_analyst add HKCU:\Software Malboxes IsAwesome String

Directories and files:

    malboxes directory <profile> <modtype> <dirpath>

Example:

    malboxes directory BadAPT57 delete C:\Windows\System32

You can add packages to install that are specific to the profile:

    malboxes package <profile> <package>

Example:

    malboxes package RansomwareThatINeedRevengeOn chrome

== Credits

After I had the idea for an improved malware analyst workflow based on what
I've been using for development on Linux servers (Vagrant) I quickly Googled
if someone was already doing something in that regard.

I found the https://github.com/m-dwyer/packer-malware[packer-malware] repo on
github by Mark Andrew Dwyer. Malboxes was boostrapped thanks to his work which
helped me especially around the areas of `Autounattend.xml` files.
