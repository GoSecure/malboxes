Builds malware analysis Windows virtual machines so that you don't have to.

https://github.com/gosecure/malboxes


== Requirements

* Python 3.3+
* packer: https://www.packer.io/docs/install/index.html
* vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox] or an vSphere / ESXi server

=== Minimum specs for the build machine

* At least 5 GB of RAM
* VT-X extensions strongly recommended

=== Fedora

    dnf install ruby-devel gcc-c++ zlib-devel
    vagrant plugin install winrm winrm-fs

=== Debian

    apt install vagrant git python3-pip


== Installation

=== Linux/Unix

* Install git, vagrant and packer using your distribution's packaging tool
  (packer is sometimes called packer-io)
* `pip install` malboxes:
+
    sudo pip3 install git+https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes


=== Windows

NOTE: Starting with Windows 10 Hyper-V is always running below the operating
system. Since VT-X needs to be operated exclusively by only one Hypervisor
https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes/issues/39[this causes VirtualBox (and
malboxes) to fail]. To disable Hyper-V and allow
VirtualBox to run, issue the following command in an administrative command
prompt then reboot: `bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off`

==== Using Chocolatey

The following steps assume that you have https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey]
installed. Otherwise, follow the <<Manually,manual installation procedure>>.

* Install dependencies:
+
    choco install python vagrant packer git virtualbox
+
* Refresh the console
+
    refreshenv
+
* Install malboxes:
+
    pip3 install setuptools
    pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes

==== Manually

* Install https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[VirtualBox],
  https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html[Vagrant] and
  https://git-scm.com/downloads[git]
* https://www.packer.io/downloads.html[Install Packer], drop the packer binary
  in a folder in your user's PATH like `C:\Windows\System32\`
* https://www.python.org/downloads/[Install Python 3] (make sure to add
  Python to your environment variables)
* Open a console (Windows-Key + cmd)
+
    pip3 install setuptools
    pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/GoSecure/malboxes.git#egg=malboxes


== Usage

=== Box creation

This creates your base box that is imported in Vagrant. Afterwards you can
re-use the same box several times per sample analysis.

Run:

    malboxes build <template>

You can also list all supported templates with:

    malboxes list

This will build a Vagrant box ready for malware investigation you can now
include it in a Vagrantfile afterwards.

For example:

    malboxes build win10_64_analyst

<<_configuration,The configuration section>> contains further information about
what can be configured with malboxes.


=== Per analysis instances

    malboxes spin win10_64_analyst <name>

This will create a `Vagrantfile` prepared to use for malware analysis. Move it
into a directory of your choice and issue:

    vagrant up

By default the local directory will be shared in the VM on the Desktop. This
can be changed by commenting the relevant part of the `Vagrantfile`.

For example:

    malboxes spin win7_32_analyst 20160519.cryptolocker.xyz


== Configuration

Malboxes' configuration is located in a directory that follows usual operating
system conventions:

* Linux/Unix: `~/.config/malboxes/`
* Mac OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/malboxes/`
* Win 7+: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\malboxes\malboxes\`

The file is named `config.js` and is copied from an example file on first run.
link:malboxes/config-example.js[The example configuration] is documented.

=== ESXi / vSphere support

Malboxes uses virtualbox as a back-end by default but since version 0.3.0
support for ESXi / vSphere has been added. Notes about the
link:docs/esx-setup.adoc[steps required for ESXi / vSphere support are
available]. Since everyone's setup is a little bit different do not hesitate
to open an issue if you encounter a problem or improve our documentation via a
pull request.

=== Profiles

We are exploring with the concept of _profiles_ which are stored separately
than the configuration and can be used to create files, alter the registry or
install additional packages. See
link:malboxes/profile-example.js[profile-example.js] for an example
configuration. This new capacity is experimental and subject to change as we
experiment with it.

== Credits

After I had the idea for an improved malware analyst workflow based on what
I've been using for development on Linux servers (Vagrant) I quickly Googled
if someone was already doing something in that regard.

I found the https://github.com/m-dwyer/packer-malware[packer-malware] repo on
github by Mark Andrew Dwyer. Malboxes was boostrapped thanks to his work which
helped me especially around the areas of `Autounattend.xml` files.
